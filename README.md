> DDD-Viewer library for viewing OpenStreetMaps data in 3D.


## Overview

DDD-Viewer is an HTML5 library for 3D visualization of scenes generated by the [DDD tool](https://github.com/jjmontesl/ddd). 

In particular, DDD-Viewer allows to show and interact with 3D maps generated from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and other datasouces.

DDD-Viewer is a TypeScript library based on [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/).

You can embed DDD-Viewer scenes in your website or use it to build a custom application.

*NOTE that this project is currently experimental and the data formats and library are expected to change.*


## Examples

- DDD-Viewer-App at [3dsmaps.com](https://3dsmaps.com).
- The [examples](examples/) directory contains simple usage examples.

*TODO: Add 1-2 screenshots*


## Using the library

DDD-Viewer is meant to be easily used as a library from 3rd party projects.

Note that if serving your own copy of DDD-Viewer, you may wish to point your users to your own
assets. See the [Configuration] and the [Assets] sections below for further information.


### From vanilla Javascript, with no bundler (\<script\> tag)

### From TypeScript

## Building the library

You need to build the library only if you wish to make changes to it 
(otherwise you can use the bundled libraries or include *ddd-viewer* through *npm*).

**Installation**

Clone the `ddd-viewer` repository and install JS/TS dependencies through `npm`:

    git clone https://github.com/jjmontesl/ddd-viewer.git

Enter the `ddd-viewer` directory (`cd ddd-viewer`) and install dependencies:

    npm install

**Npm scripts**

 - `npm run dev`: Development mode (watches source files and compiles when changes are made)
 - `npm run build`: Builds the library
<!--
 - `npm run test`: Runs a test.
 - `npm run lint`: Runs eslint to check sintax.
 - `npm run prepare`: Prepare module for production.
 -->

As in most Npm packages, these scripts are defined in the `package.json` file.

*TODO*




## Data / Assets

### Textures and object library

Currently, in order to render the primary DDD OSM 3D data you need to make some 3D and graphics assets available.

### 3D Map Tiles


### Using a caching proxy for tiles development

Accessing 

    json-caching-proxy -u https://3dsmaps.com/ -p 8000 -e '/api' -a -l
